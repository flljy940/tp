# TutorRec User Guide

TutorRec is a **desktop application designed to help tutors effectively manage their student records**.
While it features a clean and intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI), TutorRec is **optimised for fast keyboard-based interaction via a Command Line Interface (CLI)**.
This makes it ideal for tutors who prefer speed and precision when handling tasks like tracking student contacts, subjects, payment statuses, next lessons and more.
Whether you're managing a few students or a large tutoring roster, TutorRec helps you stay organised faster than most traditional GUI-based apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T16-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for TutorRec.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar tutorrec.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the contact list.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `pay 3` : Marks the 3rd contact as PAID to indicate that payment has been made.

   * `unpay 3` : Resets the 3rd contact to NOT PAID to indicate that payment has not been made.

   * `unpay all` : Resets all contacts to NOT PAID to indicate that payment has not been made by all contacts.

   * `filter-payment paid` : Shows all contacts who have paid.

   * `filter-subject math physics` : Shows all contacts taking math or physics, or both.

   * `filter-date 15/4/2025` : Shows all contacts with lessons on 15th April 2025.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [s/SUBJECT]` can be used as `n/John Doe s/math` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[s/SUBJECT]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `s/math`, `s/math s/chemistry` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME`

* Date format for next lesson must be in `d/M/yyyy HHmm-HHmm` format. <br>
  e.g. `nextlesson 3 d/15/4/2025 1800-2000`

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Saving the data

TutorRec data will be saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

TutorRec data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json` and `[JAR file location]/preferences.json`.

* `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json` stores data related to `student`.
* `[JAR file location]/preferences.json` stores data related to position and the size of the program.

Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.


<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TutorRec will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause TutorRec to behave in unexpected ways (e.g. if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TutorRec home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimise the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimised, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimised Help Window.
